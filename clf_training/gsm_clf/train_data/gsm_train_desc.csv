Cadherin-11 expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis in various cancers, including basal-like breast carcinoma and advanced prostate cancer, and invasive cell lines, yet is absent in normal epithelium.  Cadherin-11 attenuation in aggressive breast and prostate cancer cells results in marked decreases in proliferation, migration, and invasion.  Cadherin-11 depletion in MDA-231 cells prevents tumor growth in mice and alters gene expression and survival outcome associated with poor prognosis malignancies, as observed through publically available data mining.

All patients met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for the diagnosis of RA. All patients had active disease at the time of tissue sampling and were resistant to TNF blockade. They all had erosive changes imaged on conventional x-rays of the hands and/or feet. All of them had a swollen knee at inclusion. Rituximab therapy was administrated at a dose of 1,000 mg IV at baseline (T0) and at week 2, together with 125 mg IV Methylprednisolone. Clinical parameters at baseline (T0) and 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy (T12) was evaluated using DAS(28)-CRP scores and clinical responses were assessed using EULAR response criteria. Synovial biopsies were obtained by needle-arthroscopy of an affected knee from all patients at T0 and T12. For each procedure, 4 to 8 synovial samples were kept overnight at 4¬∞C in a RNA stabilizing solution (RNALater, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, TX, USA) and then stored at ‚Äì80¬∞C for later RNA extraction. The same amount of tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at ‚Äì80¬∞C for immunostaining experiments on frozen sections. The remaining material was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and paraffin embedded for conventional optical evaluation and immunostaining of selected markers. All the experiments (RNA extraction, histology, immunohistochemistry) were performed on at least 4 biopsies harvested during every procedure in order to correct for variations related to the potential heterogeneous distribution of synovial inflammation.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC05 (46 year-old female) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

Differential expression was assessed by using linear models and empirical Bayes moderated F statistics as implemented in the LIMMA package (Smyth GK, 2004). Differences in gene expression were considered significant if the P values were <0.05 after adjustment for multiple testing (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995), and thus, false discovery rate was controlled to be <5%.

"An important event in the pathogenesis of heart failure is the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In cultured cardiac cardiomyocytes, the transcription factor Gata4 is required for agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We hypothesized that in the intact organism Gata4 is an important regulator of postnatal heart function and of the hypertrophic response of the heart to pathological stress. To test;	this hypothesis, we studied mice heterozygous for deletion of the second exon of Gata4 (G4D). At baseline, G4D mice had mild systolic and diastolic dysfunction associated with reduced heart weight and decreased cardiomyocyte number. After transverse aortic constriction (TAC), G4D mice developed overt heart failure and eccentric cardiac;	hypertrophy, associated with significantly increased fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis by overexpression of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor prevented TAC-induced heart failure in G4D mice. Unlike WT-TAC controls, G4D-TAC cardiomyocytes hypertrophied by increasing in length more than width. Gene expression profiling revealed upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and;	fibrosis, including members of the TGFŒ≤ pathway. Our data demonstrate that Gata4 is essential for cardiac function in the postnatal heart. After pressure overload, Gata4 regulates the pattern of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and protects the heart from loadinduced failure.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC02 (47 year-old female) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.

"RNA was extracted from a pool of three spleens taken from three month old C57BL/10 derived B10.NOD H2g7 Idd3 congenic mice kept in sterile, specific pathogen free conditions. Target cRNA was prepared and hybridized to Eos custom GeneChip arrays (GPL24) as described for standard, commercially available Affymetrix GeneChips (Mahadevappa and Warrington 1999) and raw image data was analyzed using the GeneChip Expression Analysis Software (Affymetrix). Data for each GeneChip was normalized using a proprietary method developed at Eos (Ghandour and Glynne 2000). Briefly, for each probe array in the series background subtracted average cell intensities were fitted to a gamma distribution. These normalized cell intensities were then used to calculate an average intensity (AI) for each probe set. The AI was calculated as the trimean (T) of the probes making up a given probe set (Tukey 1977). These AI values were subjected to a second round of normalization by setting the 70th and 90th percentiles equal to the same value for each array in the series.",ctrl

"Mice and diets.  One-month-old male mice of the long-lived B6C3F1 strain were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and maintained as described after weaning (15).  Mice were housed in groups of 4 per cage and fed a non-purified diet, PMI Nutrition International Product #5001 (Purina Mills, Richmond, IN).  At 5 months of age, the mice were individually housed, and randomly assigned to one of two groups, control (CON) or long-term CR (LTCR).  CON mice were fed 93 kcal per week of a defined control diet (AIN-93M, Diet No. F05312, BIO-SERV).  LTCR mice were fed 52.2 kcal per week of a defined CR diet (AIN-93M 40% Restricted, Diet No. F05314, BIO-SERV).  The LTCR mice consumed approximately 40% fewer calories than mice in the CON mice.  The CR diet was enriched so that the CR mice consumed approximately the same amount of protein, vitamins, and minerals per gram body weight as the control mice.  Experimental design.  At 20 months of age, cohorts of mice in the CON group were randomly assigned to one of 7 experimental groups (Fig. 1).  A CON group continued to be fed 93 kcal per week of control diet for 8 weeks.  A CR8 group was fed 77 kcal per week of CR diet for 2 weeks, followed by 52.2 kcal per week of CR diet for 6 weeks.  The remaining dietary groups were fed the control diets containing, respectively, metformin (MET; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), glipizide (GLIP; Sigma), MET plus GLIP, rosiglitazone (ROS; Avandia, SmithKline Beecham) or soy isoflavone extract (SOY; NOVASOY 400, Life Extension Foundation) for 8 weeks at the dosages indicated in Table 1.  The drugs were mixed with powdered control diet and cold-pressed into one gram pellets (BIO-SERV Inc.).  At 0900, all mice were fed 2/7 of the weekly allotment of food on Monday and Wednesday and 3/7 on Friday.  The mice had free access to acidified tap water.  They were fasted for 48 hours and killed by cervical dislocation at 22 months of age.  No signs of pathology were detected in the animals used for the studies reported (n=4 per group).  Organs were removed rapidly, flash frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen.  The weights of the mice were monitored bi-weekly.

"Embryo dissections:;	All procedures involving animals have been approved previously by the Animal Care and Use Committee Tel Aviv University. ADNP heterozygous mice were housed in a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle facility and free access to rodent chow and water was available. Mice were checked for plug every three hours. Plug day was assigned as day 0 (E0). A definitive determination of the developmental stage of each embryo at the time of harvesting was also based on anatomical analysis. E9 whole embryos were separated from the extra embryonic tissue (yolk sac and amnion), immersed in ice-cold magnesium- and calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80¬∞C until analysis. The extra embryonic tissue was stored separately and used for genotyping. ;	Genotyping:;	;	Genomic DNA was extracted from embryonic yolk sacs. Lysis buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5, 5mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, proteinase K 0.35 mg/ml) was added to each sample (0.5ml) followed by a 16hr incubation period at 37¬∞C with gentle shaking. Isopropanol (0.5 ml) was then added and samples were mixed. Precipitated DNA was then transferred to a new tube containing 1ml ethanol, subjected to centrifugation at 20,000g and the resulting DNA pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 50 microLl 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA (TE) buffer. The resulting DNA was then subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to check for the existence of ADNP and/or neomycin resistance gene in the embryonic genome. The PCR mixtures contained 0.5Œºg genomic DNA, 0.25 ŒºM of each primer (sense and antisense), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 3 units Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 Œºl. (Buffers and enzyme were obtained from Life Technology Gibco BRL, Paisley, Scotland). PCR was performed using the following cycle parameters: 94 ¬∞C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles, each including 94 ¬∞C for 30 s, specific annealing temperature for 40 s and elongation at 72 ¬∞C for 40 s. Reactions were terminated at 72 ¬∞C for 10 min. Control reactions containing water instead of DNA template for each primer used (PCR-) were included.  ;	;	 RNA extraction:;	Two embryos from the same genotype and gestational time were pooled and RNA was isolated using Qiagene RNeasy mini kit (Quiagene, Hilden, Germany). Because of the small amounts of RNA extracted from one embryo at age E9 (~1.5Œºg) a two embryo pool comprised of littermates possessing the same genotype was used. For comparative experiments all embryos were at approximately the same age. ;	;	Gene array:;	;	All experiments were performed using Affymetrix MOE430A oligonucleotide arrays, as described at http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/mouse430a_2.affx. Total RNA from each sample was used to prepare biotinylated target RNA, with minor modifications from the manufacturer's recommendations (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx).;	 Briefly, 3-5 ¬µg of mRNA was used to generate first-strand cDNA by using a T7-linked oligo(dT) primer. After second-strand synthesis, in vitro transcription was performed with biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics), resulting in approximately 100-fold amplification of RNA. A complete description of procedures is available at: http://bioinf.picr.man.ac.uk/mbcf/downloads/GeneChip_Target_Prep_Protocol_CRUK_v_2.pdf.;	The target cDNA generated from each sample was processed according to manufacturer's recommendation using an Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument System;	(http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx). Briefly, spike controls were added to 10 ¬µg fragmented cDNA before overnight hybridization. Arrays were then washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, before being scanned on an Affymetrix Gene Chip scanner. A complete description of these procedures is available at;	http://bioinf.picr.man.ac.uk/mbcf/downloads/GeneChip_Hyb_Wash_Scan_Protocol_v_2_web.pdf Additionally, quality and amount of starting RNA was confirmed using an agarose gel. After scanning, array images were assessed by eye to confirm scanner alignment and the absence of significant bubbles or scratches on the chip surface. 3'/5' ratios for GAPDH and beta-actin were confirmed to be within acceptable limits (0.8-0.88), and BioB spike controls were found to be present on all the arrays, with BioC, BioD and CreX also present in increasing intensity.

All of these patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy with heated intra-pleural cisplatin chemotherapy delivered after the specimens were removed.  All normal specimens were obtained from patients who were never diagnosed with MPM.  Two human MPM cell lines (MS589 and MS428) were kindly provided by Jonathan A. Fletcher, M.D., Department of Pathology, BWH.  The JMN1B MPM cell line19,20 has been described previously.  The SV40-immortalized, non-tumorigenic mesothelial cell line (Met-5A)21 and the MPM cell line MSTO-211H22 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.  Normal tissues were obtained from additional consented patients undergoing treatment for diseases other than MPM.  All MPM samples used in these studies contained relatively pure tumor (greater than 50% tumor cells per high power field examined in a section adjacent to the tissue used).  The microscopic slides from the patients‚Äô resection specimens were reviewed by one of the authors (J.G.), and the diagnosis and histologic subclassification of MPM confirmed in all cases.  Linked clinical and pathological data were obtained for all patients who contributed tumor specimens.  Specimens and data were rendered anonymous to protect patient confidentiality.  Studies utilizing human tissues were approved by and conducted in accordance with the policies of the Institutional Review Board at BWH.",pert

All of these patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy with heated intra-pleural cisplatin chemotherapy delivered after the specimens were removed.  All normal specimens were obtained from patients who were never diagnosed with MPM.  Two human MPM cell lines (MS589 and MS428) were kindly provided by Jonathan A.

The SV40-immortalized, non-tumorigenic mesothelial cell line (Met-5A)21 and the MPM cell line MSTO-211H22 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.  Normal tissues were obtained from additional consented patients undergoing treatment for diseases other than MPM.  All MPM samples used in these studies contained relatively pure tumor (greater than 50% tumor cells per high power field examined in a section adjacent to the tissue used).  The microscopic slides from the patients‚Äô resection specimens were reviewed by one of the authors (J.G.), and the diagnosis and histologic subclassification of MPM confirmed in all cases.  Linked clinical and pathological data were obtained for all patients who contributed tumor specimens.  Specimens and data were rendered anonymous to protect patient confidentiality.

"Neural stem cells (NSC) with self-renewal and multipotent properties serve as an ideal cell source for transplantation to treat spinal cord injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. To efficiently induce neuronal lineage cells from NSC for neuron replacement therapy, we should clarify the intrinsic genetic programs involved in a time and place-specific regulation of human NSC differentiation. Recently, we established an immortalized human NSC clone HB1.F3 to provide an unlimited NSC source applicable to genetic manipulation for cell-based therapy. To investigate a role of neurogenin 1 (Ngn1), a proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, in human NSC differentiation, we established a clone derived from F3 stably overexpressing Ngn1. Genome-wide gene expression profiling identified 250 upregulated genes and 338 downregulated genes in Ngn1-overexpressing F3 cells (F3-Ngn1) versus wild-type F3 cells (F3-WT). Notably, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), a novel stem cell marker, showed a robust increase in F3-Ngn1.",pert

"Aberrant transcriptional regulation contributes to the pathogenesis of both congenital and adult forms of heart disease. While the transcriptional regulator FOG2 is known to be essential for heart morphogenesis and coronary development, its tissue specific function has not been previously investigated. Additionally, little is known about the role of FOG2 in the adult heart. Here we use spatiotemporally regulated inactivation of Fog2 to delineate its function both in embryo and adult heart. Early cardiomyocyte-restricted loss of Fog2 recapitulated the cardiac and coronary defects of the Fog2 germline knockouts. Later cardiomyocyte-restricted loss of Fog2 (Fog2MC) did not result in defects in cardiac structure or coronary vessel formation. However, Fog2MC adult mice had severely depressed ventricular function and died at 8-14 weeks. Fog2MC adult hearts displayed a paucity of coronary vessels. This was associated with myocardial hypoxia, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac fibrosis. Induced inactivation of Fog2 in adult heart resulted in similar phenotype, as did ablation of FOG2 interaction with the transcription factor GATA4. Loss of FOG2 or FOG2-GATA4 interaction altered expression of a panel of angiogenesis-related genes. Collectively, our data indicated that FOG2 regulates adult heart function and coronary angiogenesis.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient UC04 (31 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of ulcerative colitis;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient UC07 (33 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984.

"‚Ä¢ The origin of biological samples (In vitro infection of HCT-8 cells with Cryptosporidium parvum);	;	Monolayers of the HCT-8 cells (ATCC CCL-244, American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and additional nutritional supplements. Cells in log phase were plated at 2√ó106 cells per 150 mm tissue culture dish and infected with sterilised Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (Iowa strain). Purified oocysts were suspended in phosphate buffered saline, sterilised in 33% bleach for 7 min on ice, washed in Hank's buffered saline solution, and added to HCT-8 cultures at a ratio of one oocyst per cell. Following a 2 h excystation period at 37 ¬∞C, cells were washed with warm Hank's buffered saline solution, and cells were incubated in fresh supplemented media. Mock-infected cultures were treated identically, with the exception that oocysts were not added to the cultures.;	;	Three independent mock- and C. parvum-infected cultures were prepared for analysis.;	;	;	‚Ä¢ The origin of mRNA samples;	;	At 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72h post-inoculation, cell culture media were removed and cultures were immediately lysed by the addition of 3.5 ml of Trizol¬Æ reagent (GIBCO BRL Life Technologies) directly to the culture plate. Total RNA was prepared as described by the manufacturer, and poly(A) mRNA was isolated using oligo-dT cellulose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The qualities of total RNA and poly(A) mRNA preparations were assessed by Northern blot.;	;	;	‚Ä¢ Protocols for conducting microarray hybridization;	;	Poly(A) mRNA was converted into ‚Äòtarget‚Äô suitable for hybridisation to Affymetrix microarray chips according to protocols provided by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 2.0 g of poly(A) mRNA was reverse-transcribed to prepare double-stranded cDNA using T7-(dT)24 primer (GENSET Corp., La Jolla, CA) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (GIBCO). Approximately 1 g of cDNA was used for in vitro transcription in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP using the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labelling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Inc). This labelled cRNA was fragmented in 40 mM Tris‚Äìacetate (pH 8.1), 100 mM potassium acetate, and 30 mM magnesium acetate at 94 ¬∞C for 35 min. The integrity of cRNA and the efficiency of fragmentation were monitored by Northern blot analysis (not shown).;	Fragmented biotinylated cRNA targets were hybridised to HG-U95Av2 chips (Affymetrix) that contain probe sets for 12,600 human gene/transcripts. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented cRNA and appropriate controls were hybridised to the chips at 45 ¬∞C for 16 h with constant rotation at 60 rev./min. The chips were subsequently washed and stained with streptavidin‚Äìphycoerythrin conjugate using the GeneChip Fluidics station protocol EukGE_WS2 (Affymetrix). Following washing and staining, microarray chips were scanned twice at 3 m resolution using a Hewlett-Packard confocal scanner and hybridisation intensities for each of the genes/transcripts were collected from scanned images.;	;	;	‚Ä¢ Analysis of microarray data;	;	Gene expression data were initially analysed with the GeneChip¬Æ expression analysis software (Affymetrix Microarray Suite, version 5.0). The fluorescence intensity of the genes/transcripts was measured for each probe array and, to minimise discrepancies due to non-biological variations, normalised by global scaling to 1000.;	;	Further data analyses were performed using GeneSpring software (version 6.0; Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). Per gene normalisation was applied in which the expression signal of each gene in C. parvum-infected cells (raw data) was normalised to the median of its measurements in the mock-infected samples (control); and the ratio of expression levels between mock and infected samples was calculated as the mean value of normalised signal vs. control signal among three replicates. To identify genes with significantly altered expression, a series of statistical analyses (filtering) were performed: cut-off values for ratio of expression levels 1.80 and 0.55 were used to filter genes with expression level fold changes greater than ¬±1.8 in all three independent samples. Genes with fold change variations >1.5 across the three samples were excluded. Furthermore, a ‚Äòstatistical group comparison‚Äô using Student's t-test/ANOVA was conducted to compare mean expression levels between mock-infected and infected samples, and the genes with significant differential expression (P<0.05) were selected. Identified differentially expressed genes were then annotated using GeneSpring's ‚ÄòBuild Simplified Ontology‚Äô constructor which hierarchically groups genes into meaningful biological categories (gene lists) based on the Gene Ontology Consortium Classifications. Various lists of regulated genes were created by cross-referencing annotated gene lists and applying assorted statistical methods.;	",ctrl

"Female SJL/J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) at age 4-6 weeks and kept in a pathogen free environment. The microarray experiments were performed in mice 32 - 34 weeks of age. The SJL/J mouse strain has been derived from non-inbred Swiss Websterstock by brother-sister mating for 30 generations (Murphy, ED. Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 4:46, 1963) and is a naturally occurring model for autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). The SJL/J mice develop a spontaneously occurring myopathy resulting in muscle weakness (Weller, AH et al. Muscle Nerve 20, 72-82, 1997). This is due to a 171-bp deletion in the dysferlin gene of SJL mice resulting in an in-frame deletion and removal of 57amino acids (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). RNA was extracted from the left ventricle of heart of 5 SJL/J mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Total RNA was purified following the TRIzol standard protocol. Total RNA was treated by deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacture's protocol. RNA integrity was checked by denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis, and only RNA with absorbance ratios 260 nm/280 nm between 1.9 and 2.1 was used. 8 ¬µg RNA were transcribed in double-stranded cDNA by cDNA Synthesis System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). cRNA was produced by MEGAscript TM High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, USA) and labelled with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP nucleotides (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, USA). 5 left ventricle biological replicates were analyzed using standard Affymetrix procedures.;	Keywords = Mus musculus,  SJL/J, skeletal muscle, quadriceps, effect of deleted gene dysferlin",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD04 (32 year-old female) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible.;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

Each transcriptional sequence is spanned by 11-20 pairs of oligonucleotide probes randomly spaced throughout the array. All sequences designed on the array are selected from GenBank, dbEST and RefSeq. Target RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA and in-vitro transcription is performed to generate biotin-labeled cRNA for subsequent hybridization. Hybridized target cRNA is stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin and arrays are scanned using a GeneArray Scanner at an excitation wavelength of 488nm.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient UC10 (43 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

The latter groups underwent surgical procedure with vehicle. The surgical procedure and spinal cord-derived neural stem cell transplantation (intratechal injection) were done at P1 and the animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks of age.;	Frozen tissue was stored at -80¬∞C. Total RNA was purified from tissue, using the EUROZol Kit (EuroClone Ltd., United Kingdom) following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Total RNA (5 ug) was reverse-transcribed with a cDNA synthesis kit in the presence of SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo dT-T7 primer (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the cDNA pellet was air-dried and re-suspended in 12 uL of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by spectrophotometer measurement. An aliquot of each sample was conserved for gel electrophoresis and for inspection of RNA quality (i.e., 28S:18S RNA ratio). 10 ul was used for the IVT (In Vitro Transcription) amplification reaction, in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides (Enzo Biochem Inc.). Labeled cRNA (15 ug) was fragmented by incubation at 94¬∞C for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (GeneChip Sample Cleanup, Qiagen) and the fragmented cRNA was then hybridized competitively against the Affymetrix 430 2.0 Array oligonucleotide array. Hybridization occurred at 47¬∞C overnight. The arrays were scanned using a GeneArray 2500 Scanner (Affymetrix) and analyzed using MicroArray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix). All experiments were validated after direct measures of cRNA quality: 5':3' ratios for beta-actin and for GAPDH (determined from Affymetrix chip hybridization analysis) are indirect indicators of overall RNA preservation. The default parameters were used for the statistical algorithm and for probe set scaling. The target intensity was set to 1,000 to normalize expression levels across all samples. ",pert

"sample of actinic keratoses (ak_03):;	;	Carcinogenesis is a multi-step process indicated by several genes up- or down-regulated during tumor progression. The type and number of genes involved in non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) are still unclear. This study examined and identified different expressed genes in NMSC. Fifteen snap-frozen biopsies of five immunosuppressed organ-transplanted recipients each normal skin, actinic keratosis (AK) and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were analysed. Total RNA was extracted reverse transcribed and biotin-labeled cRNA was used for hybridization with Affymetrix HG-U133A gene expression cDNA-microarrays containing 22,283 known genes. Confocal scanner evaluated the signals twice and data analysis was performed by predicition analysis of microarrays (PAM) using nearest shrunken centroids with the threshold 3.5 to identify genes best characterizing normal skin and skin cancer. ANOVA analysis was performed as a second independent method to identify differentially expressed genes (p<0.05, and p<0.15). Quantitative verification of 13 up- or down-regulated genes was performed by real-time RT-PCR and genes were confirmed by sequencing. Broad coherent patterns in normal skin vs. AK and SCC were observed for 118 genes. Some of the genes (e.g. annexin, lamin, and metalloproteinases) up-regulated in carcinomas in our study have previously reported as over-expressed in NMSC. In total 42 genes were up-regulated and 76 genes were down-regulated in non-melanoma skin cancer. The majority of genes identified have not been previously reported different expressed during non-melanoma skin carcinogenesis.;	Keywords = Non-melanoma skin cancer;	Keywords = cDNA-microarray;	Keywords = expression profiling;	Keywords = expressed sequence tag (EST)",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC03 (27 year-old male) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta (HNF1beta, TCF2) is a tissue-specific transcription factor whose mutation in humans leads to renal cysts, genital malformations, pancreas atrophy and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY5). Furthermore, HNF1beta overexpression has been observed in clear cell cancer of the ovary. To identify potential HNF1beta target genes whose activity may be deregulated in human patients we established a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) expressing HNF1beta conditionally. Using Flp recombinase we introduced wildtype or mutated HNF1beta at a defined chromosomal position allowing a most reproducible induction of the HNF1beta derivatives upon tetracycline addition. By oligonucleotide microarrays we identified 25 HNF1beta regulated genes. By an identical approach we identified that the closely related transcription factor HNF1alpha (TCF1) affects only nine genes in HEK293 cells and thus is a less efficient factor in these kidney cells. The HNF1beta target genes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and osteopontin (SPP1) are most likely direct target genes, as they contain functional HNF1 binding sites in their promoter region. Since nine of the potential HNF1beta target genes are deregulated in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, we propose that HNF1beta overexpression in the ovarian cancer participates in the altered expression pattern.",ctrl

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC04 (55 year-old male) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"For the test chip, the levels of bioB, bioC, bioD, cre, phe, trp, lys, and thr will be assessed. All transcripts should be called 'present' and the average difference values of each should be in approximate;	proportion to their absolute copy number. Successful signal from bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre, but suboptimal signal from phe, trp, lys, and thr suggests that cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription was;	inefficient. Poor signal from all controls suggests a hybridization, washing, or staining failure. Normally, the bioB hybridization control (representing 2x108 transcript copies) will be at or slightly above the level of background noise. The relative expression level of GAPDH and b-actin will also be assessed. The test chip contains probes directed at the 5' and 3' end of these genes for human, mouse, and rat species.;	In general, the signals from 5' directed probe sets should be no lower than 50% of those from 3' directed probe sets. A 5'/3' ratio of less than 0.5 suggests that cDNA synthesis may have been less than efficient.",ctrl

"This study involved seven arrays (3 control, 4 treated) to assess genetic differences in breast cancer cells when cadherin-11 was stably depleted.  Cadherin-11 expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis in various cancers, including basal-like breast carcinoma and advanced prostate cancer, and invasive cell lines, yet is absent in normal epithelium.  Cadherin-11 attenuation in aggressive breast and prostate cancer cells results in marked decreases in proliferation, migration, and invasion.  Cadherin-11 depletion in MDA-231 cells prevents tumor growth in mice and alters gene expression and survival outcome associated with poor prognosis malignancies, as observed through publically available data mining.  This study was aimed at uncovering possible mechanisms associated with these facts.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD02 (38 year-old female) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible.;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984.

"Background and Aims:  Although the zinc finger transcription factor GATA4 has been implicated in regulating jejunal gene expression, the contribution of GATA4 in controlling jejunal physiology has not been addressed. Methods: We generated mice in which the Gata4 gene was specifically deleted in the small intestinal epithelium.  Measurements of plasma cholesterol and phospholipids, intestinal absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol, and gene expression were performed on these animals. Results: Mice lacking GATA4 in the intestine displayed a dramatic block in their ability to absorb cholesterol and dietary fat. Comparison of the global gene expression profiles of control jejunum, control ileum, and GATA4 null jejunum by gene array analysis demonstrated that GATA4 null jejunum lost expression of 53% of the jejunal-specific gene set and gained expression of 47% of the set of genes unique to the ileum. These alterations in gene expression included a decrease in mRNAs encoding lipid and cholesterol transporters as well as an increase in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in bile acid absorption. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that GATA4 is essential for jejunal function including fat and cholesterol absorption and confirm that GATA4 plays a pivotal role in determining jejunal versus ileal identity.",pert

"Embryo dissections: All procedures involving animals have been approved previously by the Animal Care and Use Committee Tel Aviv University. ADNP heterozygous mice were housed in a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle facility and free access to rodent chow and water was available. Mice were checked for plug every three hours. Plug day was assigned as day 0 (E0). A definitive determination of the developmental stage of each embryo at the time of harvesting was also based on anatomical analysis. E9 whole embryos were separated from the extra embryonic tissue (yolk sac and amnion), immersed in ice-cold magnesium- and calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80¬∞C until analysis. The extra embryonic tissue was stored separately and used for genotyping. Genotyping: Genomic DNA was extracted from embryonic yolk sacs. Lysis buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5, 5mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, proteinase K 0.35 mg/ml) was added to each sample (0.5ml) followed by a 16hr incubation period at 37¬∞C with gentle shaking. Isopropanol (0.5 ml) was then added and samples were mixed. Precipitated DNA was then transferred to a new tube containing 1ml ethanol, subjected to centrifugation at 20,000g and the resulting DNA pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 50 microLl 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA (TE) buffer. The resulting DNA was then subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to check for the existence of ADNP and/or neomycin resistance gene in the embryonic genome. The PCR mixtures contained 0.5Œºg genomic DNA, 0.25 ŒºM of each primer (sense and antisense), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 3 units Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 Œºl. (Buffers and enzyme were obtained from Life Technology Gibco BRL, Paisley, Scotland). PCR was performed using the following cycle parameters: 94 ¬∞C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles, each including 94 ¬∞C for 30 s, specific annealing temperature for 40 s and elongation at 72 ¬∞C for 40 s. Reactions were terminated at 72 ¬∞C for 10 min. Control reactions containing water instead of DNA template for each primer used (PCR-) were included. RNA extraction: Two embryos from the same genotype and gestational time were pooled and RNA was isolated using Qiagene RNeasy mini kit (Quiagene, Hilden, Germany). Because of the small amounts of RNA extracted from one embryo at age E9 (~1.5Œºg) a two embryo pool comprised of littermates possessing the same genotype was used. For comparative experiments all embryos were at approximately the same age. Gene array: All experiments were performed using Affymetrix MOE430A oligonucleotide arrays, as described at http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/mouse430a_2.affx. Total RNA from each sample was used to prepare biotinylated target RNA, with minor modifications from the manufacturer's recommendations (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx). Briefly, 3-5 ¬µg of mRNA was used to generate first-strand cDNA by using a T7-linked oligo(dT) primer. After second-strand synthesis, in vitro transcription was performed with biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics), resulting in approximately 100-fold amplification of RNA. A complete description of procedures is available at: http://bioinf.picr.man.ac.uk/mbcf/downloads/GeneChip_Target_Prep_Protocol_CRUK_v_2.pdf. The target cDNA generated from each sample was processed according to manufacturer's recommendation using an Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument System (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx). Briefly, spike controls were added to 10 ¬µg fragmented cDNA before overnight hybridization. Arrays were then washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, before being scanned on an Affymetrix Gene Chip scanner. A complete description of these procedures is available at http://bioinf.picr.man.ac.uk/mbcf/downloads/GeneChip_Hyb_Wash_Scan_Protocol_v_2_web.pdf Additionally, quality and amount of starting RNA was confirmed using an agarose gel. After scanning, array images were assessed by eye to confirm scanner alignment and the absence of significant bubbles or scratches on the chip surface. 3'/5' ratios for GAPDH and beta-actin were confirmed to be within acceptable limits (0.8-0.88), and BioB spike controls were found to be present on all the arrays, with BioC, BioD and CreX also present in increasing intensity.;	",ctrl

Data for each GeneChip was normalized using a proprietary method developed at Eos (Ghandour and Glynne 2000). Briefly, for each probe array in the series background subtracted average cell intensities were fitted to a gamma distribution. These normalized cell intensities were then used to calculate an average intensity (AI) for each probe set. The AI was calculated as the trimean (T) of the probes making up a given probe set (Tukey 1977). These AI values were subjected to a second round of normalization by setting the 70th and 90th percentiles equal to the same value for each array in the series.",ctrl

"Cardiac malformations due to aberrant development of the atrioventricular (AV) valves are among the most common forms of congenital heart disease. At localized swellings of extracellular matrix known as the endocardial cushions, the endothelial lining of the heart undergoes an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form mesenchymal progenitors of the AV valves. Further growth and differentiation of these mesenchymal precursors results in formation of portions of the atrial and ventricular septae, and generation of thin, pliable valves. The transcription factor Gata4 is expressed in the endothelium and mesenchyme of the AV valves. Using a Tie2-Cre transgene, we selectively inactivated Gata4 within endothelial-derived cells. Mutant endothelium failed to undergo EMT, resulting in hypocellular cushions. Mutant cushions had decreased levels of Erbb3, an EGF-family receptor essential for EMT in the atrioventricular cushions. In Gata4 mutant embryos, Erbb3 downregulation was associated with impaired activation of Erk, which is also required for EMT. Expression of a Gata4 mutant protein defective in interaction with Friend of Gata (FOG) cofactors rescued the EMT defect, but resulted in decreased proliferation of mesenchyme and hypoplastic cushions that failed to septate the ventricular inlet. We demonstrate two novel functions of Gata4 in development of the AV valves. First, Gata4 functions as an upstream regulator of an Erbb3-Erk pathway necessary for EMT, and second, Gata4 acts to promote cushion mesenchyme growth and remodeling.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC06 (57 year-old female) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient UC09 (29 year-old female) yielded to diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC10 (72 year-old male) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984.

"*Data analysis. *The array image scan is processed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite, version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) software. The GeneChip expression arrays contain control probe sets for both spiked and endogenous RNA transcripts (e.g., BioB, BioC, BioD, CreX and species-specific actin and GAPDH). Following image processing and absolute analysis of the array pattern with MAS, six values are examined to assess overall assay performance: background, noise, average Signal, % Present, ratio of Signal values for probe sets representing the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô ends of actin and GAPDH transcripts, and total Signal for probe sets for BioC, BioD and CreX. Assays demonstrating poor or marginal performance are flagged.;	An MAS 5.0 absolute expression analysis was performed for each GeneChip genome array hybridization. Following the initial analysis, the absolute analyses were rerun using global scaling to an average target intensity of */350/*. The scaling allows for the direct comparison of hybridization values from the different targets analyzed in this project (and with any additional GeneChip sample assays you run using the same array type). For each analysis, scaled or unscaled, the parameters a_1 and a_2 are set to 0.1 and 0.15 respectively. These parameters set the point at which a probeset is called present(P), marginal(M), or undetectable(A). This call is based on the Detection p-value of the probeset.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC08 (27 year-old female) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"The availability of pluripotent stem cells offers the possibility of using such cells to model hepatic disease and development. With this in mind, we previously established a protocol that facilitates the differentiation of both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluritpotent cells into cells with hepatocyte characteristics. The use of highly defined culture conditions and the avoidance of feeder cells or embryoid bodies allowed synchronous and reproducible differentiation to occur. The differentiation toward a hepatocyte‚Äìlike fate appeared to recapitulate many of the stages normally associated with the formation of hepatocytes in vivo. In the current study we addressed the feasibility of using human pluripotent stem cells to probe the molecular mechanisms underlying human hepatocyte differentiation. We demonstrate i) that human ES cells express a number of mRNAs that characterize each stage in the differentiation process, ii) that gene expression can be efficiently depleted throughout the differentiation time course using shRNAs expressed from lentiviruses, and iii) that the nuclear hormone receptor HNF4a is essential for specification of human hepatic progenitor cells by establishing expression of the network of transcription factors that control hepatocyte cell fate.",ctrl

Data for each GeneChip was normalized using a proprietary method developed at Eos (Ghandour and Glynne 2000). Briefly, for each probe array in the series background subtracted average cell intensities were fitted to a gamma distribution. These normalized cell intensities were then used to calculate an average intensity (AI) for each probe set. The AI was calculated as the trimean (T) of the probes making up a given probe set (Tukey 1977). These AI values were subjected to a second round of normalization by setting the 70th and 90th percentiles equal to the same value for each array in the series.",ctrl

"Embryo dissections: All procedures involving animals have been approved previously by the Animal Care and Use Committee Tel Aviv University. ADNP heterozygous mice were housed in a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle facility and free access to rodent chow and water was available. Mice were checked for plug every three hours. Plug day was assigned as day 0 (E0). A definitive determination of the developmental stage of each embryo at the time of harvesting was also based on anatomical analysis. E9 whole embryos were separated from the extra embryonic tissue (yolk sac and amnion), immersed in ice-cold magnesium- and calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80¬∞C until analysis. The extra embryonic tissue was stored separately and used for genotyping. Genotyping: Genomic DNA was extracted from embryonic yolk sacs. Lysis buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5, 5mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, proteinase K 0.35 mg/ml) was added to each sample (0.5ml) followed by a 16hr incubation period at 37¬∞C with gentle shaking. Isopropanol (0.5 ml) was then added and samples were mixed. Precipitated DNA was then transferred to a new tube containing 1ml ethanol, subjected to centrifugation at 20,000g and the resulting DNA pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 50 microLl 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA (TE) buffer. The resulting DNA was then subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to check for the existence of ADNP and/or neomycin resistance gene in the embryonic genome. The PCR mixtures contained 0.5Œºg genomic DNA, 0.25 ŒºM of each primer (sense and antisense), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 3 units Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 Œºl. (Buffers and enzyme were obtained from Life Technology Gibco BRL, Paisley, Scotland). PCR was performed using the following cycle parameters: 94 ¬∞C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles, each including 94 ¬∞C for 30 s, specific annealing temperature for 40 s and elongation at 72 ¬∞C for 40 s. Reactions were terminated at 72 ¬∞C for 10 min. Control reactions containing water instead of DNA template for each primer used (PCR-) were included. RNA extraction: Two embryos from the same genotype and gestational time were pooled and RNA was isolated using Qiagene RNeasy mini kit (Quiagene, Hilden, Germany). Because of the small amounts of RNA extracted from one embryo at age E9 (~1.5Œºg) a two embryo pool comprised of littermates possessing the same genotype was used. For comparative experiments all embryos were at approximately the same age. Gene array: All experiments were performed using Affymetrix MOE430A oligonucleotide arrays, as described at http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/mouse430a_2.affx. Total RNA from each sample was used to prepare biotinylated target RNA, with minor modifications from the manufacturer's recommendations (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx). Briefly, 3-5 ¬µg of mRNA was used to generate first-strand cDNA by using a T7-linked oligo(dT) primer. After second-strand synthesis, in vitro transcription was performed with biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics), resulting in approximately 100-fold amplification of RNA. A complete description of procedures is available at: http://bioinf.picr.man.ac.uk/mbcf/downloads/GeneChip_Target_Prep_Protocol_CRUK_v_2.pdf. The target cDNA generated from each sample was processed according to manufacturer's recommendation using an Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument System (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx). Briefly, spike controls were added to 10 ¬µg fragmented cDNA before overnight hybridization. Arrays were then washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, before being scanned on an Affymetrix Gene Chip scanner. A complete description of these procedures is available at http://bioinf.picr.man.ac.uk/mbcf/downloads/GeneChip_Hyb_Wash_Scan_Protocol_v_2_web.pdf Additionally, quality and amount of starting RNA was confirmed using an agarose gel. After scanning, array images were assessed by eye to confirm scanner alignment and the absence of significant bubbles or scratches on the chip surface. 3'/5' ratios for GAPDH and beta-actin were confirmed to be within acceptable limits (0.8-0.88), and BioB spike controls were found to be present on all the arrays, with BioC, BioD and CreX also present in increasing intensity.",pert

"*Data analysis. *The array image scan is processed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite, version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) software. The GeneChip expression arrays contain control probe sets for both spiked and endogenous RNA transcripts (e.g., BioB, BioC, BioD, CreX and species-specific actin and GAPDH). Following image processing and absolute analysis of the array pattern with MAS, six values are examined to assess overall assay performance: background, noise, average Signal, % Present, ratio of Signal values for probe sets representing the 5' and 3' ends of actin and GAPDH transcripts, and total Signal for probe sets for BioC, BioD and CreX. Assays demonstrating poor or marginal performance are flagged.;	An MAS 5.0 absolute expression analysis was performed for each GeneChip genome array hybridization. Following the initial analysis, the absolute analyses were rerun using global scaling to an average target intensity of */350/*. The scaling allows for the direct comparison of hybridization values from the different targets analyzed in this project (and with any additional GeneChip sample assays you run using the same array type). For each analysis, scaled or unscaled, the parameters a_1 and a_2 are set to 0.1 and 0.15 respectively. These parameters set the point at which a probeset is called present(P), marginal(M), or undetectable(A). This call is based on the Detection p-value of the probeset.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD07 (25 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible.;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient UC02 (38 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of ulcerative colitis;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.

"Aberrant transcriptional regulation contributes to the pathogenesis of both congenital and adult forms of heart disease. While the transcriptional regulator FOG2 is known to be essential for heart morphogenesis and coronary development, its tissue specific function has not been previously investigated. Additionally, little is known about the role of FOG2 in the adult heart. Here we use spatiotemporally regulated inactivation of Fog2 to delineate its function both in embryo and adult heart. Early cardiomyocyte-restricted loss of Fog2 recapitulated the cardiac and coronary defects of the Fog2 germline knockouts. Later cardiomyocyte-restricted loss of Fog2 (Fog2MC) did not result in defects in cardiac structure or coronary vessel formation. However, Fog2MC adult mice had severely depressed ventricular function and died at 8-14 weeks. Fog2MC adult hearts displayed a paucity of coronary vessels. This was associated with myocardial hypoxia, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac fibrosis. Induced inactivation of Fog2 in adult heart resulted in similar phenotype, as did ablation of FOG2 interaction with the transcription factor GATA4. Loss of FOG2 or FOG2-GATA4 interaction altered expression of a panel of angiogenesis-related genes. Collectively, our data indicated that FOG2 regulates adult heart function and coronary angiogenesis.",ctrl

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD08 (44 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

All patients had active disease at the time of tissue sampling and were resistant to TNF blockade. They all had erosive changes imaged on conventional x-rays of the hands and/or feet. All of them had a swollen knee at inclusion. Rituximab therapy was administrated at a dose of 1,000 mg IV at baseline (T0) and at week 2, together with 125 mg IV Methylprednisolone. Clinical parameters at baseline (T0) and 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy (T12) was evaluated using DAS(28)-CRP scores and clinical responses were assessed using EULAR response criteria. Synovial biopsies were obtained by needle-arthroscopy of an affected knee from all patients at T0 and T12. For each procedure, 4 to 8 synovial samples were kept overnight at 4¬∞C in a RNA stabilizing solution (RNALater, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, TX, USA) and then stored at ‚Äì80¬∞C for later RNA extraction. The same amount of tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at ‚Äì80¬∞C for immunostaining experiments on frozen sections. The remaining material was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and paraffin embedded for conventional optical evaluation and immunostaining of selected markers. All the experiments (RNA extraction, histology, immunohistochemistry) were performed on at least 4 biopsies harvested during every procedure in order to correct for variations related to the potential heterogeneous distribution of synovial inflammation.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD06 (66 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible.;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

Cadherin-11 attenuation in aggressive breast and prostate cancer cells results in marked decreases in proliferation, migration, and invasion.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD09 (50 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984.

"The availability of pluripotent stem cells offers the possibility of using such cells to model hepatic disease and development. With this in mind, we previously established a protocol that facilitates the differentiation of both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluritpotent cells into cells with hepatocyte characteristics. The use of highly defined culture conditions and the avoidance of feeder cells or embryoid bodies allowed synchronous and reproducible differentiation to occur. The differentiation toward a hepatocyte‚Äìlike fate appeared to recapitulate many of the stages normally associated with the formation of hepatocytes in vivo. In the current study we addressed the feasibility of using human pluripotent stem cells to probe the molecular mechanisms underlying human hepatocyte differentiation. We demonstrate i) that human ES cells express a number of mRNAs that characterize each stage in the differentiation process, ii) that gene expression can be efficiently depleted throughout the differentiation time course using shRNAs expressed from lentiviruses, and iii) that the nuclear hormone receptor HNF4a is essential for specification of human hepatic progenitor cells by establishing expression of the network of transcription factors that control hepatocyte cell fate.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC09 (76 year-old female) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC07 (84 year-old female) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

The AI was calculated as the trimean (T) of the probes making up a given probe set (Tukey 1977).

Cadherin-11 attenuation in aggressive breast and prostate cancer cells results in marked decreases in proliferation, migration, and invasion.  Cadherin-11 depletion in MDA-231 cells prevents tumor growth in mice and alters gene expression and survival outcome associated with poor prognosis malignancies, as observed through publically available data mining.

"Title: ERRŒ≥ Directs and Maintains the Transition to Oxidative Metabolism in the Post-Natal Heart;	Abstract: At birth the heart undergoes a critical metabolic switch to transition from a predominant dependence on carbohydrates during fetal life to a greater dependence on postnatal oxidative metabolism.  This remains the principle metabolic state throughout life; although pathologic conditions such as heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy reactivate components of the fetal genetic program to increase carbohydrate utilization. Disruption of the ERRŒ≥ gene, which is expressed at high levels in the fetal and postnatal mouse heart, blocks this switch resulting in lactatemia, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and death during the first week of life. Genomic ChIP-on-chip and expression analysis at E18.5 clearly identifies ERRŒ≥ as both a direct and indirect regulator of a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinates the postnatal metabolic transition. These findings reveal an unexpected and essential molecular genetic component of the oxidative metabolic gene program in the heart and highlight ERRŒ≥ in the study of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.;	Key Words: ChIP-on-chip, electrocardiography, fetal gene program, OXPHOS, PGC-1Œ±, sodium current",pert

"Female SJL/J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) at age 4-6 weeks and kept in a pathogen free environment. The microarray experiments were performed in mice 32 - 34 weeks of age. The SJL/J mouse strain has been derived from non-inbred Swiss Websterstock by brother-sister mating for 30 generations (Murphy, ED. Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 4:46, 1963) and is a naturally occurring model for autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). The SJL/J mice develop a spontaneously occurring myopathy resulting in muscle weakness (Weller, AH et al. Muscle Nerve 20, 72-82, 1997). This is due to a 171-bp deletion in the dysferlin gene of SJL mice resulting in an in-frame deletion and removal of 57amino acids (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). RNA was extracted from the left ventricle of heart of 5 SJL/J mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Total RNA was purified following the TRIzol standard protocol. Total RNA was treated by deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacture's protocol. RNA integrity was checked by denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis, and only RNA with absorbance ratios 260 nm/280 nm between 1.9 and 2.1 was used. 8 ¬µg RNA were transcribed in double-stranded cDNA by cDNA Synthesis System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). cRNA was produced by MEGAscript TM High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, USA) and labelled with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP nucleotides (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, USA). 5 left ventricle biological replicates were analyzed using standard Affymetrix procedures.;	Keywords = Mus musculus,  SJL/J, cardiac muscle, left ventricle, effect of deleted gene dysferlin",pert

"This study involved seven arrays (3 control, 4 treated) to assess genetic differences in breast cancer cells when cadherin-11 was stably depleted.  Cadherin-11 expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis in various cancers, including basal-like breast carcinoma and advanced prostate cancer, and invasive cell lines, yet is absent in normal epithelium.  Cadherin-11 attenuation in aggressive breast and prostate cancer cells results in marked decreases in proliferation, migration, and invasion.  Cadherin-11 depletion in MDA-231 cells prevents tumor growth in mice and alters gene expression and survival outcome associated with poor prognosis malignancies, as observed through publically available data mining.

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient UC06 (38 year-old female) yielded to diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984.

"Mice and diets.  One-month-old male mice of the long-lived B6C3F1 strain were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and maintained as described after weaning (15).  Mice were housed in groups of 4 per cage and fed a non-purified diet, PMI Nutrition International Product #5001 (Purina Mills, Richmond, IN).  At 5 months of age, the mice were individually housed, and randomly assigned to one of two groups, control (CON) or long-term CR (LTCR).  CON mice were fed 93 kcal per week of a defined control diet (AIN-93M, Diet No. F05312, BIO-SERV).  LTCR mice were fed 52.2 kcal per week of a defined CR diet (AIN-93M 40% Restricted, Diet No. F05314, BIO-SERV).  The LTCR mice consumed approximately 40% fewer calories than mice in the CON mice.  The CR diet was enriched so that the CR mice consumed approximately the same amount of protein, vitamins, and minerals per gram body weight as the control mice.  Experimental design.  At 20 months of age, cohorts of mice in the CON group were randomly assigned to one of 7 experimental groups (Fig. 1).  A CON group continued to be fed 93 kcal per week of control diet for 8 weeks.  A CR8 group was fed 77 kcal per week of CR diet for 2 weeks, followed by 52.2 kcal per week of CR diet for 6 weeks.  The remaining dietary groups were fed the control diets containing, respectively, metformin (MET; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), glipizide (GLIP; Sigma), GLIP plus MET (GM), rosiglitazone (ROS; Avandia, SmithKline Beecham) or soy isoflavone extract (SOY; NOVASOY 400, Life Extension Foundation) for 8 weeks at the dosages indicated in Table 1.  The drugs were mixed with powdered control diet and cold-pressed into one gram pellets (BIO-SERV Inc.).  At 0900, all mice were fed 2/7 of the weekly allotment of food on Monday and Wednesday and 3/7 on Friday.  The mice had free access to acidified tap water.  They were fasted for 48 hours and killed by cervical dislocation at 22 months of age.  No signs of pathology were detected in the animals used for the studies reported (n=4 per group).

"One-month-old male mice of the long-lived B6C3F1 strain were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and maintained as described after weaning (15).  Mice were housed in groups of 4 per cage and fed a non-purified diet, PMI Nutrition International Product #5001 (Purina Mills, Richmond, IN).  At 5 months of age, the mice were individually housed, and randomly assigned to one of two groups, control (CON) or long-term CR (LTCR).  CON mice were fed 93 kcal per week of a defined control diet (AIN-93M, Diet No. F05312, BIO-SERV).  LTCR mice were fed 52.2 kcal per week of a defined CR diet (AIN-93M 40% Restricted, Diet No. F05314, BIO-SERV).  The LTCR mice consumed approximately 40% fewer calories than mice in the CON mice.  The CR diet was enriched so that the CR mice consumed approximately the same amount of protein, vitamins, and minerals per gram body weight as the control mice.;	Experimental design.  At 20 months of age, cohorts of mice in the CON group were randomly assigned to one of 7 experimental groups (Fig. 1).  A CON group continued to be fed 93 kcal per week of control diet for 8 weeks.  A CR8 group was fed 77 kcal per week of CR diet for 2 weeks, followed by 52.2 kcal per week of CR diet for 6 weeks.  The remaining dietary groups were fed the control diets containing, respectively, metformin (MET; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), glipizide (GLIP; Sigma), MET plus GLIP, rosiglitazone (ROS; Avandia, SmithKline Beecham) or soy isoflavone extract (SOY; NOVASOY 400, Life Extension Foundation) for 8 weeks at the dosages indicated in Table 1.  The drugs were mixed with powdered control diet and cold-pressed into one gram pellets (BIO-SERV Inc.).  At 0900, all mice were fed 2/7 of the weekly allotment of food on Monday and Wednesday and 3/7 on Friday.  The mice had free access to acidified tap water.  They were fasted for 48 hours and killed by cervical dislocation at 22 months of age.  No signs of pathology were detected in the animals used for the studies reported (n=4 per group).  Organs were removed rapidly, flash frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen.  The weights of the mice were monitored bi-weekly.  Mouse weights are given in Table 1.;	Measurement of specific mRNA levels.

"Neural stem cells (NSC) with self-renewal and multipotent properties serve as an ideal cell source for transplantation to treat spinal cord injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. To efficiently induce neuronal lineage cells from NSC for neuron replacement therapy, we should clarify the intrinsic genetic programs involved in a time and place-specific regulation of human NSC differentiation. Recently, we established an immortalized human NSC clone HB1.F3 to provide an unlimited NSC source applicable to genetic manipulation for cell-based therapy. To investigate a role of neurogenin 1 (Ngn1), a proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, in human NSC differentiation, we established a clone derived from F3 stably overexpressing Ngn1. Genome-wide gene expression profiling identified 250 upregulated genes and 338 downregulated genes in Ngn1-overexpressing F3 cells (F3-Ngn1) versus wild-type F3 cells (F3-WT). Notably, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), a novel stem cell marker, showed a robust increase in F3-Ngn1.",ctrl

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient UC08 (51 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com).

"*Data analysis. *The array image scan is processed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite, version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) software. The GeneChip expression arrays contain control probe sets for both spiked and endogenous RNA transcripts (e.g., BioB, BioC, BioD, CreX and species-specific actin and GAPDH). Following image processing and absolute analysis of the array pattern with MAS, six values are examined to assess overall assay performance: background, noise, average Signal, % Present, ratio of Signal values for probe sets representing the 5' and 3' ends of actin and GAPDH transcripts, and total Signal for probe sets for BioC, BioD and CreX. Assays demonstrating poor or marginal performance are flagged.;	An MAS 5.0 absolute expression analysis was performed for each GeneChip genome array hybridization. Following the initial analysis, the absolute analyses were rerun using global scaling to an average target intensity of */350/*. The scaling allows for the direct comparison of hybridization values from the different targets analyzed in this project (and with any additional GeneChip sample assays you run using the same array type). For each analysis, scaled or unscaled, the parameters a_1 and a_2 are set to 0.1 and 0.15 respectively. These parameters set the point at which a probeset is called present(P), marginal(M), or undetectable(A). This call is based on the Detection p-value of the probeset.",ctrl

"Title: ERRŒ≥ Directs and Maintains the Transition to Oxidative Metabolism in the Post-Natal Heart;	Abstract: At birth the heart undergoes a critical metabolic switch to transition from a predominant dependence on carbohydrates during fetal life to a greater dependence on postnatal oxidative metabolism.  This remains the principle metabolic state throughout life; although pathologic conditions such as heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy reactivate components of the fetal genetic program to increase carbohydrate utilization. Disruption of the ERRŒ≥ gene, which is expressed at high levels in the fetal and postnatal mouse heart, blocks this switch resulting in lactatemia, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and death during the first week of life. Genomic ChIP-on-chip and expression analysis at E18.5 clearly identifies ERRŒ≥ as both a direct and indirect regulator of a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinates the postnatal metabolic transition. These findings reveal an unexpected and essential molecular genetic component of the oxidative metabolic gene program in the heart and highlight ERRŒ≥ in the study of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.;	Key Words: ChIP-on-chip, electrocardiography, fetal gene program, OXPHOS, PGC-1Œ±, sodium current",ctrl

All SLE patients had active articular disease at the time of synovial tissue sampling, and none had received immunosuppressive therapy; some of the SLE patients were receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. All patients with RA met the ACR classification criteria for RA (6) and all had early (<1 year's duration) active disease at the time of tissue sampling. Among the patients with RA, 2 were female and 5 were male, and the mean age was 51 years (range 37‚Äì69 years).

Data for each GeneChip was normalized using a proprietary method developed at Eos (Ghandour and Glynne 2000).  Briefly, for each probe array in the series background subtracted average cell intensities were fitted to a gamma distribution.  These normalized cell intensities were then used to calculate an average intensity (AI) for each probe set.  The AI was calculated as the trimean (T) of the probes making up a given probe set (Tukey 1977).  These AI values were subjected to a second round of normalization by setting the 70th and 90th percentiles equal to the same value for each array in the series.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD01 (20 year-old male) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible.;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

Methods: LECs were isolated from livers by collagenase perfusion, isopycnic centrifugation and incubation of cells with magnetic beads coated with specific antibodies.Total RNA was extracted from LECs with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) after the cell-isolation step described above. RNA quality and concentration were confirmed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). cRNA samples were hybridized to the Rat Expression 230A oligonucleotide microarray (Affymetrix).

"Background and Aims:  Although the zinc finger transcription factor GATA4 has been implicated in regulating jejunal gene expression, the contribution of GATA4 in controlling jejunal physiology has not been addressed. Methods: We generated mice in which the Gata4 gene was specifically deleted in the small intestinal epithelium.  Measurements of plasma cholesterol and phospholipids, intestinal absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol, and gene expression were performed on these animals. Results: Mice lacking GATA4 in the intestine displayed a dramatic block in their ability to absorb cholesterol and dietary fat. Comparison of the global gene expression profiles of control jejunum, control ileum, and GATA4 null jejunum by gene array analysis demonstrated that GATA4 null jejunum lost expression of 53% of the jejunal-specific gene set and gained expression of 47% of the set of genes unique to the ileum. These alterations in gene expression included a decrease in mRNAs encoding lipid and cholesterol transporters as well as an increase in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in bile acid absorption. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that GATA4 is essential for jejunal function including fat and cholesterol absorption and confirm that GATA4 plays a pivotal role in determining jejunal versus ileal identity.",ctrl

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient CD05 (24 year-old female) yielded to diagnosis of Crohn's disease.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible.;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

"Female SJL/J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) at age 4-6 weeks and kept in a pathogen free environment. The microarray experiments were performed in mice 32 - 34 weeks of age. The SJL/J mouse strain has been derived from non-inbred Swiss Websterstock by brother-sister mating for 30 generations (Murphy, ED. Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 4:46, 1963) and is a naturally occurring model for autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). The SJL/J mice develop a spontaneously occurring myopathy resulting in muscle weakness (Weller, AH et al. Muscle Nerve 20, 72-82, 1997). This is due to a 171-bp deletion in the dysferlin gene of SJL mice resulting in an in-frame deletion and removal of 57amino acids (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). RNA was extracted from the left ventricle of heart of 5 SJL/J mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Total RNA was purified following the TRIzol standard protocol. Total RNA was treated by deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacture's protocol. RNA integrity was checked by denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis, and only RNA with absorbance ratios 260 nm/280 nm between 1.9 and 2.1 was used. 8 ¬µg RNA were transcribed in double-stranded cDNA by cDNA Synthesis System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). cRNA was produced by MEGAscript TM High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, USA) and labelled with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP nucleotides (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, USA). 5 left ventricle biological replicates were analyzed using standard Affymetrix procedures.;	Keywords = Mus musculus,  SJL/J,  skeletal muscle, quadriceps, effect of deleted gene dysferlin",pert

Data for each GeneChip was normalized using a proprietary method developed at Eos (Ghandour and Glynne 2000). Briefly, for each probe array in the series background subtracted average cell intensities were fitted to a gamma distribution. These normalized cell intensities were then used to calculate an average intensity (AI) for each probe set. The AI was calculated as the trimean (T) of the probes making up a given probe set (Tukey 1977). These AI values were subjected to a second round of normalization by setting the 70th and 90th percentiles equal to the same value for each array in the series.",ctrl

"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta (HNF1beta, TCF2) is a tissue-specific transcription factor whose mutation in humans leads to renal cysts, genital malformations, pancreas atrophy and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY5). Furthermore, HNF1beta overexpression has been observed in clear cell cancer of the ovary. To identify potential HNF1beta target genes whose activity may be deregulated in human patients we established a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) expressing HNF1beta conditionally. Using Flp recombinase we introduced wildtype or mutated HNF1beta at a defined chromosomal position allowing a most reproducible induction of the HNF1beta derivatives upon tetracycline addition. By oligonucleotide microarrays we identified 25 HNF1beta regulated genes. By an identical approach we identified that the closely related transcription factor HNF1alpha (TCF1) affects only nine genes in HEK293 cells and thus is a less efficient factor in these kidney cells. The HNF1beta target genes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and osteopontin (SPP1) are most likely direct target genes, as they contain functional HNF1 binding sites in their promoter region. Since nine of the potential HNF1beta target genes are deregulated in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, we propose that HNF1beta overexpression in the ovarian cancer participates in the altered expression pattern.",pert

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC11 (41 year-old female) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

Mice given simvastatin 20mg/kg for 48 hr prior to sample collection (2 doses of simvastatin).;	Sample_age: 7-8 weeks old;	Sample_hybridization: total RNA was converted to first-strand cDNA using a hybrid reverse transcription primer consisting of oligo-dT and T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequences. The single-stranded cDNA was then converted to double-stranded cDNA. Complementary DNA corresponding to 5-10 ¬µg of total RNA was used in a cRNA amplification step using T7 RNA polymerase and two biotinylated nucleotide precursors. The resulting biotinylated cRNA was fragmented to a size of approximately 50 bp, and approximately 20-30 ¬µg of the biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to the Mouse430 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The bound cRNA was visualized by binding of streptavidin/phycoerythrin conjugates to the hybridized GeneChip, followed by laser scanning of bound phycoerythrin.;	Sample_RNA_Isolation: Tissues (~50 mg) were taken frozen and directly solubilized in chaotropic solubilization buffer using a Brinkman Polytron tissue disruptor. Larger tissue fragments (>100mg) were pulverized into frozen powder with a mortar and pestle, pre-chilled to liquid nitrogen temperature, and then the frozen powder was solubilized with the Polytron. RNA was purified using Trizol LS (Life Technologies) and an additional RNA purification step was conducted using the RNAeasy purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA).

"Mice were sacrificed by a rising concentration of CO2 and livers were immediately removed for preparation of RNA. Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver with a phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate reagent, TRIzol (Invitrogen) and further purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd) in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. RNA was pooled from three animals of each genotype for each experiment, and the experiments were carried out twice. Results from the two experiments were exactly the same. The A260/280 ratio of total RNA used was typically ¬≥ 1.9. The quality of RNA was assessed by using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.;	The probe labelling and hybridisation procedures were conducted by following the Affymetrix Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA by using Superscript ds-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, U.K.) with a T7-(dT)24 primer incorporating a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The cRNA was prepared and biotin-labelled by in vitro transcription by using BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labelling Kit (ENZO Biochemical). Labelled cRNA was fragmented by incubation at 940C for 35 min in the presence of 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100mM potassium acetate, and 30 mM magnesium acetate. The samples were tested with hybridization to GeneChip Test3 arrays and analysed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Fragmented cRNA (15 mg) was hybridized 16h at 450C to an MG_U74Av2 array (Affymetrix). After hybridization, the gene chips were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin by using a fluidics station (Affymetrix). The chips were scanned in an Agilent G2500A scanner. Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays utilize multiple perfect-match and mismatch oligonucleotides to determine expression levels, so Affymetrix GCOS software was used to scan, determine the presence and the average difference value, and assess signal intensity of each probe set. Chip fluorescence was normalized by scaling total chip fluorescence intensity to a common value of 100 prior to comparison, and a normalisation value was set at 1. Data and statistical analyses were performed with Genespring Ver 6.1 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) bioinformatics algorithms.",ctrl

"Sample Type: Cells, Tissue: nasal epithelial cells (level II region), Tissue Harvest Methods: The nose was dissected to isolate the Level II region of both nostrils.  The maxillo turbinate and olfactory epithelium were discarded and the lateral meatus and nasoturbinate were retained for cell isolation.  The dissected nasal sections were rinsed with cold phosphate buffered saline to remove the blood.  After rinsing, a 5 ml buffered mixture of proteases (collagenase, 80 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich; pronase, 10 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich; HEPES, 0.1 M) in Hams F12 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the nose and incubated at 37¬∞C for 40 minutes to remove the epithelial cell layer.  Following incubation, the mixture was vortexed and the resulting cell suspension was collected in a clean centrifuge tube.  The cell suspension was centrifuged (200 x g, 10 min, 10¬∞C) and the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ?L PBS and 200 ?L RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX).

"Pathohistological and clinical examination of Patient NC01 (44 year-old male) yielded no significant pathological findings.  This patient was considered as a normal control for the purposes of the study.;	Target Labeling and Hybridization procedure:;	100-250 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA for each patient using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.  Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983).  Reversed transcribed cDNA from patient targets were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously, with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out at 42¬∞C for 50 min (Eickhoff et al. 2000).  RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68¬∞C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl.  Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).;	Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80¬∞C.  These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction.  Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm).  The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50¬∞C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL).  The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42¬∞C.  Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65¬∞C.  Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.  Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). After hybridization, filters were individually stripped in a boiling solution of 0.5% SDS for 5 min, taken off the heat and agitated for an additional 3 hrs at room temperature and stored damp wrapped in plastic wrap at ‚Äì20¬∫C for 7-8 weeks (half-life of 33P is 25.4 days). Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984.

Prior to re-use, filters were re-scanned as above to ensure that residual radioactivity was negligible;	Spot quantitation:;	An exposure time of ~24 h was sufficient to yield signals from cDNA clones, yet keeping the data overflow to a mimimum.  Images were quantified using VisualGrid¬Æ software V3.4 (http://www.gpc-biotech.com). Each grid was manually adjusted to the image such that the linear correlation coefficient between duplicate spots was greater than 0.984. ID (Location) 95A01 - 96P24 contained spotting buffer only and were flaged as empty / set to zero.;	References:;	Eickhoff, H. et al.

Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver with a phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate reagent, TRIzol (Invitrogen) and further purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd) in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. RNA was pooled from three animals of each genotype for each experiment, and the experiments were carried out twice. Results from the two experiments were exactly the same. The A260/280 ratio of total RNA used was typically ¬≥ 1.9. The quality of RNA was assessed by using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.;	The probe labelling and hybridisation procedures were conducted by following the Affymetrix Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA by using Superscript ds-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, U.K.) with a T7-(dT)24 primer incorporating a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The cRNA was prepared and biotin-labelled by in vitro transcription by using BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labelling Kit (ENZO Biochemical). Labelled cRNA was fragmented by incubation at 940C for 35 min in the presence of 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100mM potassium acetate, and 30 mM magnesium acetate. The samples were tested with hybridization to GeneChip Test3 arrays and analysed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Fragmented cRNA (15 mg) was hybridized 16h at 450C to an MG_U74Av2 array (Affymetrix). After hybridization, the gene chips were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin by using a fluidics station (Affymetrix). The chips were scanned in an Agilent G2500A scanner. Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays utilize multiple perfect-match and mismatch oligonucleotides to determine expression levels, so Affymetrix GCOS software was used to scan, determine the presence and the average difference value, and assess signal intensity of each probe set. Chip fluorescence was normalized by scaling total chip fluorescence intensity to a common value of 100 prior to comparison, and a normalisation value was set at 1.

"Cardiac malformations due to aberrant development of the atrioventricular (AV) valves are among the most common forms of congenital heart disease. At localized swellings of extracellular matrix known as the endocardial cushions, the endothelial lining of the heart undergoes an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form mesenchymal progenitors of the AV valves. Further growth and differentiation of these mesenchymal precursors results in formation of portions of the atrial and ventricular septae, and generation of thin, pliable valves. The transcription factor Gata4 is expressed in the endothelium and mesenchyme of the AV valves. Using a Tie2-Cre transgene, we selectively inactivated Gata4 within endothelial-derived cells. Mutant endothelium failed to undergo EMT, resulting in hypocellular cushions. Mutant cushions had decreased levels of Erbb3, an EGF-family receptor essential for EMT in the atrioventricular cushions. In Gata4 mutant embryos, Erbb3 downregulation was associated with impaired activation of Erk, which is also required for EMT. Expression of a Gata4 mutant protein defective in interaction with Friend of Gata (FOG) cofactors rescued the EMT defect, but resulted in decreased proliferation of mesenchyme and hypoplastic cushions that failed to septate the ventricular inlet. We demonstrate two novel functions of Gata4 in development of the AV valves. First, Gata4 functions as an upstream regulator of an Erbb3-Erk pathway necessary for EMT, and second, Gata4 acts to promote cushion mesenchyme growth and remodeling.",ctrl

"An important event in the pathogenesis of heart failure is the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. In cultured cardiac cardiomyocytes, the transcription factor Gata4 is required for agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We hypothesized that in the intact organism Gata4 is an important regulator of postnatal heart function and of the hypertrophic response of the heart to pathological stress. To test;	this hypothesis, we studied mice heterozygous for deletion of the second exon of Gata4 (G4D). At baseline, G4D mice had mild systolic and diastolic dysfunction associated with reduced heart weight and decreased cardiomyocyte number. After transverse aortic constriction (TAC), G4D mice developed overt heart failure and eccentric cardiac;	hypertrophy, associated with significantly increased fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis by overexpression of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor prevented TAC-induced heart failure in G4D mice. Unlike WT-TAC controls, G4D-TAC cardiomyocytes hypertrophied by increasing in length more than width. Gene expression profiling revealed upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and;	fibrosis, including members of the TGFŒ≤ pathway. Our data demonstrate that Gata4 is essential for cardiac function in the postnatal heart. After pressure overload, Gata4 regulates the pattern of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and protects the heart from loadinduced failure.",ctrl

The latter groups underwent surgical procedure with vehicle. The surgical procedure and spinal cord-derived neural stem cell transplantation (intratechal injection) were done at P1 and the animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks of age.;	Frozen tissue was stored at -80¬∞C. Total RNA was purified from tissue, using the EUROZol Kit (EuroClone Ltd., United Kingdom) following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Total RNA (5 ug) was reverse-transcribed with a cDNA synthesis kit in the presence of SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo dT-T7 primer (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the cDNA pellet was air-dried and re-suspended in 12 uL of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by spectrophotometer measurement. An aliquot of each sample was conserved for gel electrophoresis and for inspection of RNA quality (i.e., 28S:18S RNA ratio). 10 ul was used for the IVT (In Vitro Transcription) amplification reaction, in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides (Enzo Biochem Inc.). Labeled cRNA (15 ug) was fragmented by incubation at 94¬∞C for 35 minutes in fragmentation buffer (GeneChip Sample Cleanup, Qiagen) and the fragmented cRNA was then hybridized competitively against the Affymetrix 430 2.0 Array oligonucleotide array. Hybridization occurred at 47¬∞C overnight. The arrays were scanned using a GeneArray 2500 Scanner (Affymetrix) and analyzed using MicroArray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix). All experiments were validated after direct measures of cRNA quality: 5':3' ratios for beta-actin and for GAPDH (determined from Affymetrix chip hybridization analysis) are indirect indicators of overall RNA preservation. The default parameters were used for the statistical algorithm and for probe set scaling. The target intensity was set to 1,000 to normalize expression levels across all samples. ",ctrl

"Mice and diets.  One-month-old male mice of the long-lived B6C3F1 strain were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and maintained as described after weaning (15).  Mice were housed in groups of 4 per cage and fed a non-purified diet, PMI Nutrition International Product #5001 (Purina Mills, Richmond, IN).  At 5 months of age, the mice were individually housed, and randomly assigned to one of two groups, control (CON) or long-term CR (LTCR).  CON mice were fed 93 kcal per week of a defined control diet (AIN-93M, Diet No. F05312, BIO-SERV).  LTCR mice were fed 52.2 kcal per week of a defined CR diet (AIN-93M 40% Restricted, Diet No. F05314, BIO-SERV).  The LTCR mice consumed approximately 40% fewer calories than mice in the CON mice.  The CR diet was enriched so that the CR mice consumed approximately the same amount of protein, vitamins, and minerals per gram body weight as the control mice.;	Experimental design.  At 20 months of age, cohorts of mice in the CON group were randomly assigned to one of 7 experimental groups (Fig. 1).  A CON group continued to be fed 93 kcal per week of control diet for 8 weeks.  A CR8 group was fed 77 kcal per week of CR diet for 2 weeks, followed by 52.2 kcal per week of CR diet for 6 weeks.  The remaining dietary groups were fed the control diets containing, respectively, metformin (MET; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), glipizide (GLIP; Sigma), MET plus GLIP, rosiglitazone (ROS; Avandia, SmithKline Beecham) or soy isoflavone extract (SOY; NOVASOY 400, Life Extension Foundation) for 8 weeks at the dosages indicated in Table 1.  The drugs were mixed with powdered control diet and cold-pressed into one gram pellets (BIO-SERV Inc.).  At 0900, all mice were fed 2/7 of the weekly allotment of food on Monday and Wednesday and 3/7 on Friday.  The mice had free access to acidified tap water.  They were fasted for 48 hours and killed by cervical dislocation at 22 months of age.  No signs of pathology were detected in the animals used for the studies reported (n=4 per group).

"Female SJL/J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) at age 4-6 weeks and kept in a pathogen free environment. The microarray experiments were performed in mice 32 - 34 weeks of age. The SJL/J mouse strain has been derived from non-inbred Swiss Websterstock by brother-sister mating for 30 generations (Murphy, ED. Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 4:46, 1963) and is a naturally occurring model for autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). The SJL/J mice develop a spontaneously occurring myopathy resulting in muscle weakness (Weller, AH et al. Muscle Nerve 20, 72-82, 1997). This is due to a 171-bp deletion in the dysferlin gene of SJL mice resulting in an in-frame deletion and removal of 57amino acids (Bittner, RE et al. Nature Genet 23, 141-142, 1999). RNA was extracted from the left ventricle of heart of 5 SJL/J mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Total RNA was purified following the TRIzol standard protocol. Total RNA was treated by deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacture's protocol. RNA integrity was checked by denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis, and only RNA with absorbance ratios 260 nm/280 nm between 1.9 and 2.1 was used. 8 ¬µg RNA were transcribed in double-stranded cDNA by cDNA Synthesis System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). cRNA was produced by MEGAscript TM High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, USA) and labelled with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP nucleotides (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, USA). 5 left ventricle biological replicates were analyzed using standard Affymetrix procedures.;	Keywords = Mus musculus,  SJL/J,  cardiac muscle, left ventricle, effect of deleted gene dysferlin",pert
